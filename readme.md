#Component Structure

# Notes

* Had to install File Loader dependency to keep linter/webpack from erroring out on build. Ultimately had to upgrade my file-loader from what was pinned -- which probably means I have another version number somewhere that doesn't match the curriculum.

* Installed, and eventually uninstalled, material-ui for React. Bit of a rabbit hole of functionality that I don't need yet.

* Button font defaults to Arial if Robot is not set in a css module or inline style. Maybe not inheriting from HTML?

* Had to do a fair bit of image editing to get my splash image to resize in proportion to header/nav.
